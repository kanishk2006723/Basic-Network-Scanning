# Basic-Network-Scanning
First i open the teminal in desktop and then use ifconfig command to see the ip of my machine to scan network 
 And then use nmap command:- nmap -sS 10.0.1.0/24
 to scan my local network in my kali machine
 then i found some common ports in my network witch are shown in scan file.
 After that i anaylise the incomeing and outgoing packet in my network through wireshark 
 witch screenshort is provided in the result pdf
 then i study some common open ports in my network like:-
 1521/tcp (oracle)
 3306/tcp (mysql)
 8080/tcp (http-proxy)
 witch are some most common ports witch can be exploited if not use with care
 and i study the potencial risk on leveing this common ports open 
 witch are explain in detail in the result pdf
